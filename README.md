# Object Detection for the Blind Using Python

## Overview
This project provides an object detection system designed to assist visually impaired individuals by identifying and announcing objects in their environment using Python. The system utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect objects in real-time via a camera feed and communicate these findings through audio.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using a webcam or external camera.
- Audio announcements of detected objects.
- Customizable object detection model for specific needs.
- Easy setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A webcam or external camera

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-blind.git
    cd object-detection-blind
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the object detection script:
    ```bash
    python detect.py
    ```
2. The system will begin detecting objects via your camera and announce them through your system's audio output.

## Customization
To customize the object detection model, follow these steps:
1. Open `config.py` and modify the settings as needed.
2. Replace the pre-trained model with your own model by placing it in the `models/` directory and updating the path in `detect.py`.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.
